//Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:
//
//Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.
//
//Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.
//
//Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.
//
//Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
//
//Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: N = 3
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 
//We can at most get 3 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
//A, A, A
// 
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: N = 7
//Output: 9
//Explanation: 
//We can at most get 9 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
//A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
