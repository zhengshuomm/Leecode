//Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.
//
//The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.
//
//A black lonely pixel is character 'B' that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.
//
//Example:
//
//Input: 
//[['W', 'W', 'B'],
// ['W', 'B', 'W'],
// ['B', 'W', 'W']]
//
//Output: 3
//Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.
